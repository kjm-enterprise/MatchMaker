# MatchMaker 

## App Overview

**Why Matchmaker?**

MatchMaker was designed to bridge like minded gamers to one another.  The idea of the app
is to connect gamers in a *"Tinder"* like fashion through showcasing their interests in gaming 
and allow the user to match with another gamer that allows them to play together. The apps 
intention is to just connect gamers play matches together, however if love were to happen it
would happen.  Happy Matching!

## Deployment Instructions

Step 1 - [Clone Git Repository](https://github.com/kjm-enterprise/MatchMaker) 

Step 2 - When creating a new project clone the project from the cloned link generated in the Git Repo for MatchMaker.

Step 3 - DO NOT OPEN THE project when prompted to. Keep the project closed and select the import option.

Step 4 - Then import the project from Maven and ensure that the Java language level is set at 1.8.

Step 5 - In the dropdown next to the run and debug symbols, create an app configuration and call it "app". This will allow you to build the app fully.

Step 6 - Download a google-services.json file of your own to obtain a key to utilize firebase messaging. 
those steps [can be found here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

Step 7 - Run the project and your app should be up and running.

## User Instructions

1) Launch the app

2) Sign in with a valid google account.  If you do not have a google account [click here to sign up](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en-GB&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp&nogm=true). 

3) After signing in you will be prompted to a screen showing you first match option. The option
will either allow you to attempt to match with the other user or pass on the user.  You will only
match with the user if the other user has the same mutual desire to match with you. 

4) After you have a match with a user, they will be stored in your "Matches" tab in the button below.  Eventually 
this feature will let you recall the information that was presented to you upon first matching.

5) If you would like to message your match you may do so within the messaging function of the app. This 
will allow you to set up communication together to actually game together! 

6) The last item to explore is your "User Profile" which will eventually allow ou to set your different
gaming consoles and allow you to change your profile picture that is shown to others.
