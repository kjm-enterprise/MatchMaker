#MatchMaker 

##App Overview

**Why Matchmaker?**

MatchMaker was designed to bridge like minded gamers to one another.  The idea of the app
is to connect gamers in a *"Tinder"* like fashion through showcasing their interests in gaming 
and allow the user to match with another gamer that allows them to play together. The apps 
intention is to just connect gamers play matches together, however if love were to happen it
would happen.  Happy Matching!
